        --------------------------
        1. **Time expiry**  — order older than ``candle_expiry`` candles.
        2. **Distortion event** — a market-wide shock was detected this cycle
           (central bank surprise, war escalation, etc.). All pending limits
           are cancelled regardless of how fresh they are.
        3. **Regime change** — the market-regime *class* has changed since the
           signal was created (RANGE → TREND, TREND → VOLATILE, etc.).
           Minor intra-class fluctuations within the same label are NOT
           treated as a change, so the rule is stable without being hair-
           trigger.
        4. **VIX spike** — India VIX is both above ``vix_spike_threshold``
           AND has risen by ≥ ``VIX_SPIKE_RELATIVE`` × the VIX that was
           present when the signal fired, indicating an abrupt fear event.

        ORJ-001: Append-only reconciliation of historical SIM_ paper records.

        rows persist in paper_trades.csv forever and trigger ORPHAN POSITION
        ALERTs on every container restart.

        Safety conditions (ALL must hold to reconcile a single row):
          1. order_id starts with "SIM_"   — paper record; was never sent to Dhan
          2. event OPEN with no CLOSE      — genuinely unmatched in journal

          4. age ≤ _DEEP_ORPHAN_DAYS (60d) — within extended scan horizon
